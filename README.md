# Dev Wallet

## Overview

The Dev Wallet is a Web Extension that enables consumers to inspect, modify, and manipulate the state of Ethereum using a local forked node such as Anvil. The Dev Wallet is compatible with any dapp (i.e. perform simulated swaps on uniswap.org), and comes with the tools to inspect and manipulate the state of an account (balances, nonces, etc) and the local forked node (blocks, contracts, time travel, transactions). 

It is "god mode" for Ethereum â€“ you can do anything you want, but only on your forked instance.
